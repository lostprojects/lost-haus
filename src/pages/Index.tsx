              Tucked into an old Over-the-Rhine garage, <span className="font-semibold text-brand">Somerhaus</span> is Cincinnati's green-lined playground for people who like their gatherings a little less ordinary. Concrete floors meet climbing vines, daylight pours through the long skylight & roll-up door. The space hums with the energy of artists, makers, and neighbors who've already tested the limits of what a "venue" can do.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hand-made it this way on purposeâ€”to be open, flexible, and ready for whatever you're dreaming up. Pop in for a long-table dinner, a pop-up market, a micro-wedding, or a late-night idea sprint; our room adapts without losing its character.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want a space that feels alive, rooted in the neighborhood, and wide-open to creativity, you're in the right spot.
