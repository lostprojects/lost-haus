Location: 1415 Republic St., Cincinnati, OH 45202

Located in the heart of Cincinnati’s historic Over-the-Rhine neighborhood (downtown Cincinnati). One block from Vine St. and Washington Park, Somerhaus is incredibly well-located in the center of everything Cincinnati has to offer.

Parking:

Washington Park’s underground parking garage is one block away (about a 2-minute walk from the northeast elevator). The new open-air 3CDC lot at Vine St. & 15th is also nearby. Mercer Commons Garage is two blocks away (4-minute walk). Street parking may be available on nearby streets, but Republic Street is permit parking only – you may be ticketed or towed if you park on Republic. (We advise using a garage/lot, the streetcar, or a rideshare service for ease of parking.)

Vendors

(Somerhaus provides flexibility with vendors and offers a list of preferred vendors for clients’ convenience.)

You are welcome to bring in your own preferred vendors or caterers. Please note that a service fee is applied for events with catering: 12% service fee if you use a caterer from our preferred list, or 15% service fee for outside (non-preferred) caterers. This fee covers venue-related costs such as staff labor, administrative needs, communications and planning with vendors, on-site meetings, additional supplies, facility maintenance, overhead, documentation preparation, event setup or furniture adjustments, client walkthroughs, etc. This catering service fee (event production fee) is not a gratuity for the caterer.

Due to street access limitations at our venue, food trucks are not permitted. Also, since catering is outsourced and caterers will use venue resources (power, water, kitchen, etc.), the service fee helps cover those costs as well.
