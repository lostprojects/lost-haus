## Part 1 – Google Business Profile Optimisation

### Why It Matters  
60-70 % of clicks go to the **Map Pack**. If you are not in the top three you are effectively invisible, regardless of organic rankings.

### Step-by-Step  
1. **Audit the current profile** – note missing fields & incorrect data.  
2. **Add up to 10 categories.**  
3. **List 30-50 specific services.**  
4. Populate every field: description, hours, attributes, photos, Q&A.  
5. Publish one GBP post per week going forward.

### Copy & Paste Prompt  
```text
Act as a Local SEO strategist.  
Business type: {PRIMARY_CATEGORY}.  
Location: {CITY}.  

1. Suggest up to 10 GBP categories ranked by relevance.  
2. Suggest 30 specific GBP services.  
Return as two comma-separated lists.
```

> After completing Part 1 our plumber moved from **position 20+ → 17.5**.

## Part 2 – Perfect Website Structure

### Why It Matters  
Google trusts websites that *mirror* their associated GBP. Relevance + Coverage = Authority.

### Core Principles  
• Every GBP *category* becomes an **H2 section on the home page**.  
• Every **service** gets its own page.  
• Every URL contains the *service* and *city* (e.g. `/water-heater-installation-plano`).  
• Content must be **locally-specific** (neighbourhoods, regulations, landmarks).

### Minimal Viable Structure (Plumber Example)  
```
Home  
 ├─ Drainage Service (H2)  
 ├─ Gas Installation Service (H2)  
 ├─ …  
Category Pages  
 ├─ /heating-contractor-plano  
 ├─ /drain-cleaning-plano  
 └─ … (5 categories)  
Service Pages  
 ├─ /toilet-repair-plano  
 ├─ /sewer-line-replacement-plano  
 └─ … (30 services)
```

### AI Content Prompt  
```text
Write a 750-word page about {SERVICE} in {CITY}.  
Include:  
• Intro as a local expert & licence holder.  
• 2–3 neighbourhood references.  
• 3 FAQs with rich answers.  
• Call-to-action with phone number.  
Tone: Friendly, professional, authoritative.
```

> Using the prompt above we produced **40 pages in one afternoon** and jumped to **position 10**.

## Part 3 – Technical & Trust Signals

### Mandatory Items  
1. **LocalBusiness schema** on the home page (JSON-LD).  
2. **Google Map embed** on contact page.  
3. **NAP consistency** (Name • Address • Phone) everywhere.  
4. **Quality local backlinks** – Chamber of Commerce, sponsorships, niche citations.

### Schema Prompt  
```text
Generate JSON-LD LocalBusiness schema.  
Data:  
Name: "{BUSINESS_NAME}"  
Address: "{STREET}, {CITY}, {POSTCODE}"  
Phone: "{PHONE}"  
URL: "{URL}"  
SameAs: ["{GBP_URL}", "{FACEBOOK_URL}", "{INSTAGRAM_URL}"]  
```

> After implementing these signals + a handful of $35 links, the plumber landed at **position 2.35** — and the phone *wouldn't stop ringing*.

## FAQs

**Is AI content safe?**  
Yes, provided it is unique, helpful and locally specific. Google evaluates quality, not authorship.

**Do I need 40 pages?**  
You need enough content to cover *every service + location* your GBP lists. For some businesses that is less, others more.

**What link metrics matter most?**  
Relevance and trust. A Chamber of Commerce link can outperform dozens of generic blog links.
